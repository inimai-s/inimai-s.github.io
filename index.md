<div class="about">
I'm a Fulbright scholar currently at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Golm. I'm interested in using gravitational waves and other transient phenomena to learn about stellar populations, large-scale structure, and the history of the universe. I'm a member of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Scientific Collaboration. 

I recently graduated from MIT, where I studied physics and mathematics. I'm a 2023 [Astronaut Scholar](https://astronautscholarship.org/scholars.html) and the winner of the 2024 [MIT Barrett Prize](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/student-awards/#:~:text=The%20Barrett%20Prize). In 2024, I attended the [73rd Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting](https://mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/meetings/2024). I'm excited to begin my PhD at Princeton starting fall 2025.

In my free time, I like to [write](https://aqcheng.substack.com), [read](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/174364104-april-cheng), try new caf√©s, and play video games.

## selected research <div id="research">
* *In progress* - dark siren cosmology with cross-correlations! 
* *In preparation* - I built the first [library](https://github.com/aqcheng/illustris_frb) to simulate full-sky fast radio bursts (FRBs) by ray tracing through the [Illustris-TNG cosmological simulation](https://tng-project.org/). I ran a variety of experiments to study systematics in cross-correlations of FRB dispersion measures and foreground galaxies.
* [(LIGO T2300368)](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-T2300368/public) - As a 2023 [LIGO SURF](https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/LIGO_web/students/SURF/), I studied astrophysically-motivated correlations in population properties of merging black holes. I forecasted 3rd-generation detection capabilities and also studied the biases of searching for a correlation with an imposed phenomelogical model.
* [(ApJ 955 127)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aced98) - Using astrophysically-motivated models to infer the formation origins of binary black holes ([Zevin+ 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abe40e)), I updated the analysis with GWTC-3, made forecasts for GWTC-4, and explicitly showed the biases that arise from wrong or incomplete prior astrophysical knowledge.

## outreach <div id="outreach">

The road ahead is long, but so is my journey thus far. In high school, I participated in the [International Olympiad for Astronomy and Astrophysics](https://usaaao.org/about/history/) and Science Olympiad. Without these outreach programs, I wouldn't be where I am. 

Since 2020, I have been heavily involved in writing astronomy tests and developing resources for the Astronomy event of Science Olympiad. A (nearly) comprehensive list of these can be found [here](/scioly/). Other outreach involvements are in the works...
